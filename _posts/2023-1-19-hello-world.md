title: Typing without moving
---

## What?
I'm trying to learn how to use Talon Voice to drive my computer and write some code using Emacs and Clojure, but [the default Talon repository](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon)  doesn't contain configuration for either Emacs or Clojure. [I created a repository](https://github.com/sduckett/talon-dev-workflow) to hold a set of overrides as I figure out what I need in order to translate the key presses that are in my muscle memory into my speaking voice.

## Why?
My hands aren't working right now.

## Driving Emacs
What do I need to do inside of Emacs? I need to open a file, save a file, start a Cider repel, compile a buffer, switch from a buffer to the REPL, invoke `projectile` commands, invoke `imenu`, jump from one line to another, etcetera.

## Vocabulary to add 
- `repel` vs. `repl`
- `closure` vs. `clojure`
- emacs should be capitalized
- `get` vs. `git`

## What is hard so far?
- saying the word "delete" vs. getting "dot"
- saying "focus firefox" results in being told the switcher does not work
- because I am just now learning talon it is hard to drive with only my voice and not using the keyboard
- there is still a lot of documentation to read
- counting the number of words backwards to move is a little bit difficult with my eyeballs
- my internal monologue usually runs while my hands are typing

## What is easy so far?
- "go way up" is nice
- using the nato phonetic alphabet is naturally easy, even if it is not efficient
