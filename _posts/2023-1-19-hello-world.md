## What?
I'm trying to learn how to use Talon Voice to drive my computer and write some code using Emacs and Clojure, but the default Talon repository doesn't contain configuration for either Emacs or Clojure. [I created a repository](https://github.com/sduckett/talon-dev-workflow) to hold a set of overrides as I figure out what I need in order to translate the key presses that are in my muscle memory into my speaking voice.

## Why?
My hands aren't working right now.
